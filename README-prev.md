Iâ€™m George Markle. I've been involved with homeowners associations for the past four decades and authored the *Homeowners Association Directors' Survival Kit.*

Anyone involved professionally or on a board of a community association is nausiatingly-familiar with the dearth of willing, qualified volunteers competent in the skills of overseeing what for many of its members constitutes the bulk of their net worth. Normal means for ensuring competence for such stewardship involves the state requiring certification and licensure for those positioned to imact lives so profoundly. However, the conundrum plaguing communitites accross our country is the untenable burden for unpaid volunteers to pursue such credentialling â€” with no renumeration or ostensible personal reward and the prospect of absorbing relentless political ire. Who in their right mind would serve in this roll?!

Thus, we have all seen and read about consequences of unsophisticated governance of community associations â€” from petty irritations of hapless adminstration of architectural applications preventing a homeowner from flying a flag, to catastrophic loss and devestation of an entire community and lost lives, resulting from failure to maintain adequate reserves for buliding infrustructure maintenance.

For the past few years I've contemplated this as-yet unsolved puzzle of essential requirements for competent oversight vs. circumstances malignantly aligned to defeat it. I finally began crafting a plan â€” a decidedly unconventional approach involving incentives to education and improve competency for community association directors. And it explodes conventional local- and state government barriers to involve the marketplace. Get ready for an interesting ride.

But if two heads are better than one, opening this up to many contributors has the potential to craft a truly great and effective program. We can use each other's help on all aspects, including sanity checks, legal review, awareness of potential unexpected barriers and a raft of other surprises certain to arise. It'll be an adventure!

Please read the plan in the [**HOA Cert Program.md**](/HOA%20Cert%20Program.md) file and give me your comments and suggestions so we can make it better â€” before we begin working with our legislators to implement.

Isn't. It. Time?
