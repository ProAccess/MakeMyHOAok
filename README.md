### Iâ€™m George Markle of @ProAccess
Iâ€™m overseeing development of a plan to incent education and competency for community association board members. Condo, coop and planned development boards operate in a unique environment that makes them especially vulnerable to untrained and underinformeed directors, and sometimes with catastrophic consequences. Please read the plan in the [**HOA Cert Program.md**](/HOA Cert Program.md) file and give me your comments and suggestions so we can make it better â€” before we begin working with our legislators to begin implementing.
