### I’m George Markle
For the past year or so I’ve been working on a novel plan to incent education and competency for community association board members. Condo, coop and planned developments are governed in environments that makes them especially vulnerable to untrained and underinformed volunteer directors — sometimes with catastrophic consequences. Please read the plan in the [**HOA Cert Program.md**](/HOA%20Cert%20Program.md) file and give me your comments and suggestions so we can make it better — before we begin working with our legislators to implement.

Isn't it time?
